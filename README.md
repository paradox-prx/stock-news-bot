Overview
StockBotAgent is an AI-powered assistant designed to analyze and forecast stock trends by leveraging news sentiment and technical indicators. Built using the react-agents library, it provides users with comprehensive insights and actionable recommendations on specific stock tickers.

Features
News Sentiment Analysis: Fetches and analyzes the latest news articles related to a stock to determine market sentiment.
Historical Price Data Retrieval: Retrieves historical stock prices over a specified date range for in-depth analysis.
Technical Indicators Calculation: Calculates key technical indicators such as Moving Average (MA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
Comprehensive Stock Analysis: Combines sentiment data and technical indicators to provide detailed analysis and forecasts.
Actionable Recommendations: Offers explicit investment recommendations like strong buy, hold, or sell calls based on the analysis.
How It Works
The agent follows a structured process to deliver accurate and insightful stock analyses:

User Interaction: The user requests an analysis or prediction for a specific stock ticker.
Fetching News Sentiment: The agent retrieves sentiment analysis data for the stock over the last 30 days using the StockNewsAPI.
Retrieving Historical Prices: It fetches historical stock price data for the past 60 days using the Polygon.io API.
Calculating Technical Indicators: The agent calculates MA, EMA, and MACD based on the historical price data.
Data Analysis: It combines the news sentiment and technical indicators to form a comprehensive analysis.
Providing Recommendations: Based on predefined criteria, the agent provides an explicit recommendation (e.g., strong buy, sell, hold).
User Output: The analysis and recommendation are presented to the user in a detailed and understandable format.
